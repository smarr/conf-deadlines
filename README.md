# conf-deadlines

This is a little project to have an easy way to see the up-coming deadlines.
The current implementation relies on a data file that is generated partially
by scrapping [conf.researchr.org](https://conf.researchr.org/), and partially
using directly provided data.

It is mostly for my own use, but if someone finds it useful, pull requests are welcome.

Please see [smarr.github.io/conf-deadlines](https://smarr.github.io/conf-deadlines/) for the result.
